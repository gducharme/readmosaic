The Guardian Who Reads This Fanfic
Mother of a 14-year-old, works in public health, reads “for research” on social media platforms

Moral Anchor: Fear of exposure—not to harm, but to unbearable ambiguity.
What She Notices First: She skips the kiss, goes straight to the pregnancy line—and feels sick.
Red Line: *The lack of consequence—no STI talk, no “what if?” after.
What She Wants Changed:
“Show one moment of regret, not guilt—just a child realizing: ‘I wasn’t ready, and he didn’t ask.’

That’s the story I needed at her age.”
