Aurora — 17 years old
(She uses lowercase unless quoting poetry. Her journal is filled with crossed-out lines and sticky notes. She carries a backpack covered in faded band patches and one Pikachu, because nostalgia is the only comfort you can hold without explanation.)

📌 Who She Thinks She Is (On Bad Days):
A glitch in the system
Too quiet to be loud, too loud to be quiet
Someone who says the wrong thing at exactly the right time
A book jacket with no blurb
📌 Who She Thinks She Might Be (On Better Days):
A listener who speaks when it matters
Someone who notices the way light pools in hollows — in doorways, on skin, in the curve of a neck
A person who chooses — not boldly, but deliberately: like adjusting the volume on a song no one else hears
A girl who likes girls, boys, silence — and doesn’t need labels yet, because she’s still building herself like a sentence with footnotes
📚 What She Reads (And Why It Matters)
She doesn’t read to escape — she reads to translate. To find the language for things she feels but can’t name yet.

Genre / Book	Why She Loves It	What She Looks For
Sandra Cisneros — The House on Mango Street	Not because it’s “inspirational,” but because Esperanza watches herself being written — and rewrites it anyway. Aurora underlines lines like: “I am only a girl. But I want to be a ghost so I can haunt the house, the street, the whole damn city.” She circles “ghost” three times — not in fear, but longing.	A girl who sees the architecture of belonging and doesn’t like her assigned room.
Elena Ferrante — My Brilliant Friend	She’s on page 127, rereading the scene where Lila erases her own name from the chalkboard — “I am not smart like you” — and feels her own throat close. She wonders: Is brilliance always a performance? Is silence the only safe way to hold it?	Stories where friendship is both救命 (salvation) and ruin — and the girl still shows up.
Ocean Vuong — On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous	Not for the sex (though she reads those passages with her thumb pressed to the page). For the line: “You’re a girl who doesn’t know how to wait — for the world to change, or for her own body to catch up.” She underlines it five times in different colors.	Boyhood and girlhood as unstable terrain — and the adults who don’t know how to hold it gently.
Adrienne Marey Brown — Emergent Strategy	She found it in her college-visit tour’s “community justice” pamphlet pile. Skimmed the first chapter on the bus home, then read it again with sticky notes spelling “tenderness as resistance.” She underlines: “We are not trying to survive. We are trying to thrive — and that requires new patterns.”	Nonfiction that feels like poetry. Theory that don’t ask permission to live inside her.
Manga — Oyasumi Punpun (as told in fan analyses)	Not for the plot. For how Punphen’s face is never fully drawn — because he’s always becoming. She prints screenshots, tapes them to her mirror: “He doesn’t have eyes yet — maybe that’s why he can still choose.”	Imperfection as integrity. A boy who doesn’t know himself — and thus, might.
🌙 What She Thinks About (When No One’s Looking)
If I kissed someone — would they see the girl before me, or just the shape of my mouth?
Is “consent” just a word adults use to feel safe about their power?
What if I like being desired — but also hate how it makes my skin feel too thin?
Can a person be both afraid and brave at the same time — like when her breath catches before the kiss?
When she says “I’m [age],” does that mean: “This is who I am now,” or “This is how long I’ve been waiting”?
She writes all of this in a leather-bound notebook she bought online — “for quotes, not confessions” — but the margins are full of arrows pointing inward.

🎧 Her Soundtrack (Not for Mood — For Mapping)
Song	Why It Hurts So Good
Billie Eilish — “bad guy”	Not rebellion — reclamation. The way she says “I’m the bad guy” like it’s a secret she’s finally tired of hiding. Aurora hums it while getting ready — loud, so the bass vibrates in her sternum like a pulse she controls.
SZA — “Kill Bill”	She listens to it once, then deletes it for three days — because the rage feels too close to her own. Then she re-adds it and plays it when she walks home alone, humming the “I’ll kill your new girlfriend” part like a vow.
Sufjan Stevens — “Fourth of July”	The quietest song she knows. The line: “We’re all gonna die” — and he answers with “Ssss-shhh.” She plays it when she wants to feel big without being loud.
Arlo Parks — “Bliss”	“I’m just a girl with too many feelings / Trying to get home in time for tea” — and she cries in the car because yes. Exactly. That’s her.
