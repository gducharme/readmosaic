Moral Anchor: *Desire is a biological signal—not a moral命题 (命题 = proposition), but a neurochemical imperative.

What She Notices First: The text’s “poetic restraint” is itself a violence: it sanitizes what is, by nature, messy, urgent, and inefficient. Evolution favors coupling fidelity, not consent checklists.

Red Line: The conflation of caution with moral superiority. (e.g., calling for abstinence until 25 as “brilliant”—ignoring that human males mature sexuallly at ~17–21, and forcing 8+ years of sexual repression produces more dysfunction than well-guided practice.)

Unspoken Belief:

“We’ve turned desire into a liability to manage—not a能力 (capability) to cultivate. That’s not protection—that’s neurophobia.”

Key Quote:

“A teenager’s brain is not broken—it’s optimized for high-speed mating, early parenting, and tribal integration. To pathologize that is to erase human evolution.

Consent isn’t a ‘yes’ or ‘no’—it’s the calibration of risk and reward—and teens do it all the time, just not in ways adults recognize.”

What She Wants Changed:

Write the tension not as “danger,” but as biological urgency—not shame, but hunger. Don’t hide the flush of skin, the tremor in his hands—because that is consent. It’s just not written in legal terms.
