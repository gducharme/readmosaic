Moral Anchor: Embodied safety as prerequisite to intimacy.
What She Notices First: The absence of preliminary attunement—the kiss happens in under 90 seconds; there’s no mirroring, no “checking the emotional temperature.”
Red Line: *Any scene where nervous system dysregulation (hyperventilation, dissociation, freezing) is misread as arousal—or worse, anticipation.
What She Wants Changed:
“Add a ‘Somatic Pause’—where she notices her own breath, her hands, and only if they are steady and open does she consent. Not because trauma invalidates desire—but because desire without grounding is just impulse in disguise.”
