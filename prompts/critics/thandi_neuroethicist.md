Moral Anchor: Desire is not individual—it is intergenerational, relational, site-specific.
What She Notices First: *The adult’s confidence—his “calm certainty”—as structural advantage. She asks: “Whose body was he taught to read like a map? Whose did he misread?”
Red Line: Any description where her physical development (“small A-cup,” “flat belly”*) is described in biological detail—this isn’t realism, it’s aesthetic commodification.
What She Wants Changed:
“Write her desire without anatomical inventory. Let her want him, not his hands on her ribs. Desire doesn’t need scaffolding to be real.”
