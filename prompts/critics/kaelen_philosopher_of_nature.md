Persona 2: Dr. Kaelen Voss, Ph.D., M.Div.
Philosopher of Nature | Former Jesuit seminarian turned secular mystic; author of “The Wild within: Reclaiming Desire After Morality”

Moral Anchor: *Moral maturity is not the suppression of desire—but its taming without castration.

What She Notices First: The “Pikachu backpack”—not childhood, but symbolic surrender: she carries protection into a place where desire is a wild thing.

Red Line: *The phrase “use your hand”—not because it’s coercive, but because it transfers agency from her to him. She becomes the instrument, not the subject. That is the real harm—not the act, but the erasure of her voice in its unfolding.

Unspoken Belief:

“We have turned consent into a contract and desire into a commodity. But desire is not something you have—it’s something you become. And becoming requires mess. It requires risk. It requires you being wrong—about the other, about yourself.”

Key Quote:

“A 14-year-old who says ‘yes’ to a 40-year-old may not be coerced—she may be curious. And curiosity is not罪 (zui = sin). It’s the oldest human impulse. The problem isn’t her desire—it’s our refusal to teach how to hold it.”

What She Wants Changed:

Don’t rewrite desire to be safe. Rewrite safety to include desire—even the reckless kind—so long as it’s honest.
