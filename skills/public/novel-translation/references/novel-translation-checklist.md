# Novel Translation Checklist (Voice + Narrative Truth)

## 1) Authorial Intent and Narrative Contract

- Preserve genre signals (romance, noir, epic fantasy, literary fiction) and reader expectation.
- Keep POV discipline stable (1st/3rd person, close vs omniscient).
- Protect narrative promises (clues, foreshadowing, reveals).

## 2) Voice and Style

- Preserve sentence music: rhythm, breath, cadence, and punctuation performance.
- Preserve diction texture: plain vs ornate, archaic vs modern, regional color.
- Keep intentional repetition motifs repeated.
- Preserve recurring metaphor systems and symbolic logic.

## 3) Character Integrity

- Preserve each character idiolect: vocabulary, slang, politeness, and swearing profile.
- Preserve social-class and profession markers in speech.
- Preserve humor mode (dry, absurd, biting) per character.
- Keep emotional authenticity; avoid over-cleaning messy speech unless source intends it.

## 4) Dialogue Realism

- Write natural turn-taking for the target language, not stiff literalism.
- Preserve subtext (what remains unsaid).
- Preserve terms of address (titles, nicknames, honorifics) as relationship signals.
- Calibrate swearing intensity to avoid personality drift.

## 5) Culture-Bound Elements

- Decide foreignization vs domestication explicitly for food, places, and customs.
- Decide how to handle allusions: keep, lightly reframe, or annotate as needed.
- Keep names/transliteration consistent, especially for series.

## 6) Continuity and Series Bible

- Maintain a proper noun bible for places, factions, artifacts, and system terms.
- Check timeline and factual continuity (dates, ages, distances, world rules).
- Avoid retcon risk from inconsistent key phrases.

## 7) Meaning Precision Where It Matters

- Protect clue-bearing lexical choices in mysteries.
- Preserve legal/contract wording exactness when plot-critical.
- For poetry/songs/prophecies, choose a priority per passage:
  - meaning
  - meter
  - rhyme

## 8) Sensitive Content and Ethics

- Preserve tone of violence/sex and consent cues accurately.
- Preserve slurs/hate speech per authorial intent and historical setting while following publisher policy.
- Avoid accidental distortion in mental health depictions.

## 9) Typography and Presentation

- Preserve formatting voice across chapter titles, epigraphs, letters, texts, and diaries.
- Adapt italics/quotes and thought-marking to target-language conventions without flattening effect.
- Apply punctuation norms without neutralizing voice.

## 10) QA Approach

- Pass 1: Fidelity + continuity.
- Pass 2: Voice + flow (target-language editorial perspective).
- Pass 3: Consistency sweep using glossary/bible.
- Use read-aloud checks for dialogue and rhythm.

## 11) Edge Cases

- Preserve functional wordplay (anagrams, acrostics, hidden messages) or mark losses.
- Use explicit analogue strategy for non-mapping dialects.
- Preserve ambiguity in unreliable narrators.
- Keep sacred phrases (chants, oaths, refrains) stable across the work.
