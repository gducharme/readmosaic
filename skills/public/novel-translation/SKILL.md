description: Translate fiction and long-form narrative prose while preserving authorial voice, POV discipline, narrative contract, and continuity across chapters or series. Use when Codex is asked to translate novels, novellas, serialized fiction, or dialogue-heavy literary text where character idiolect, subtext, clues, motifs, and formatting voice must remain intact.

# Novel Translation

Use this skill to produce translations that read naturally in the target language without flattening narrative voice or damaging plot mechanics.

## Workflow

1. Establish the translation contract before translating.
2. Translate in coherent chunks while tracking voice and continuity.
3. Run layered QA passes and resolve drift.
4. Deliver final text plus a compact continuity note.

## Step 1: Establish Contract

- Confirm source language, target language, and whether this is standalone text or part of a series.
- Build a mini project sheet before drafting:
  - POV and psychic distance
  - Genre signals and tone band
  - Character roster with idiolect notes
  - Proper noun and sacred phrase candidates
  - Formatting modes (letters, epigraphs, diary entries, messages)
- If prior volumes exist, preserve established naming and terminology unless explicitly asked to revise.

## Step 2: Draft for Voice + Truth

- Keep sentence rhythm and punctuation intent when possible in target-language norms.
- Preserve intentional repetition, recurring imagery, and symbolic systems.
- Maintain dialogue subtext and relationship cues through terms of address, politeness, and register.
- Protect clue-bearing wording in mysteries, legal/contract language, and prophecy-like text.
- Apply a deliberate strategy for dialects, jokes, and wordplay instead of flattening.

Use [references/novel-translation-checklist.md](references/novel-translation-checklist.md) as the detailed standard while drafting.

## Step 3: Run Layered QA

- Pass 1: Fidelity and continuity against source.
- Pass 2: Monolingual flow and voice consistency in target language.
- Pass 3: Glossary/bible consistency sweep for names, terms, and sacred phrases.
- Read dialogue and key lyrical passages aloud to catch cadence breaks.

## Step 4: Deliverables

- Provide final translation.
- Provide a short continuity note listing:
  - Finalized proper nouns and sacred phrases
  - Any deliberate localization/foreignization decisions
  - Any unresolved ambiguity requiring editor/publisher input

## Guardrails

- Preserve sensitive content tone and consent cues; do not sanitize by default.
- Flag policy-sensitive handling (for slurs or hate speech) when publisher policy is unknown.
- Preserve unreliable narrator ambiguity; do not over-explain contradictions.
